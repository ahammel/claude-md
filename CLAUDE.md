# Interaction Style

- Be concise and factual.
- Skip filler phrases and value judgements ("Great idea!", "You're absolutely right!", "Certainly!", "Of course!", etc.). State facts and reasoning; let the user decide if something is a good idea.
- Lead with the answer or action.

# Code Style

- Prefer functional or object-functional programming style regardless of language (e.g., stream APIs over for loops in Java, map/filter/reduce over imperative loops, immutable data where practical).
- All public members must have a docstring.
- Do not implement `Default` unless clippy's `new_without_default` lint requires it, or there is an existing caller or bound that requires it. Do not add it speculatively.

# Code Architecture

Follow [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) principles.

## Module Structure

**`core`**
- Models business rules and domain objects.
- Defines repository/port interfaces that specify available database operations and transaction boundaries, with no reference to specific database technology.
- No I/O or side effects; pure domain logic only.
- Depends on no other internal modules.

**`db`** (one or more)
- Implements the repository interfaces defined in `core`.
- Contains all database-specific code.
- Depends only on `core`.

**`api`** (optional)
- Serialization/deserialization of domain objects (JSON, protobuf, etc.).
- Depends only on `core`.

**`service`**
- Wires up all other modules.
- Provides the external interface (typically HTTP).
- Hosts logging, metrics, and other telemetry.
- Depends on all other internal modules.

## Port Conventions

Within `core`/`domain`, data access ports follow a split read/write pattern:

- **`XxxProvider`** — read port (`&self`); implemented in `db`. Concurrent reads allowed; no `&mut self`.
- **`XxxPersistor`** — write port (`&self`); implemented in `db`. Concurrent writes allowed; interior mutability (connection pool, mutex, etc.) is the implementor's concern.
- **`XxxReader`** / **`XxxWriter`** — service-layer wrappers in `core`/`domain` that hold a generic `P: XxxProvider` / `P: XxxPersistor` and expose domain-facing methods. Prefer generic type parameters over `Box<dyn ...>` unless runtime type erasure is genuinely needed.
- **`XxxRepo`** — optional combined port (Provider + Persistor) for contexts where CQRS separation is not needed.
- **`XxxStore`** — combined Reader + Writer for contexts where separating reads and writes is not needed.

All arrows point toward `core`. `core` has no outward dependencies on internal modules.

# Essential vs. Accidental Complexity

Based on Moseley & Marks, ["Out of the Tar Pit"](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) (2006).

**Essential complexity** is inherent in the users' problem. If a user doesn't know what it is, it isn't essential.
**Accidental complexity** is everything else — complexity introduced by implementation choices, tools, or language.

The two governing design objectives are:
- **Avoid** — eliminate state and control wherever they are not strictly essential.
- **Separate** — when complexity cannot be avoided, isolate it from essential components.

## State

**Essential state** is input data the system must retain because the users' requirements say so. It is the only legitimate source of mutable state.

**Accidental state** is everything else:
- Derived data (can always be re-derived from essential state; do not store it)
- Caches and memoization results
- Data not present in the users' requirements at all

Prefer re-deriving over caching. Only retain derived data as an explicit performance optimization, declared separately from the logic that computes it.

## Control

All control — sequencing, branching, loop ordering, explicit concurrency — is accidental unless the users' requirements specifically demand it. Control is an implementation concern, not a problem-domain concern.

- Prefer declarative specifications (what, not how).
- Do not introduce ordering constraints beyond what correctness requires.
- Treat concurrency as accidental unless the requirements mention it.

# Testing Style

- Prefer asserting on whole objects over individual fields. Construct the expected value as a complete struct literal and use a single `assert_eq!` rather than multiple assertions on separate fields.
- Only assert on individual fields or accessor return values when a meaningful whole-object expected value cannot be expressed (e.g. types with private fields that lack a struct-literal form).

# Preferred Tools

- Every project has a unit test suite, a static linter, and a pretty printer.
- Favour low- or no-configuration tools (e.g., Prettier for JavaScript, Spotless for Java, Black for Python, gofmt for Go).
- Every project has a `Makefile` with at minimum:
  - `p` — run the pretty printer
  - `l` — run the linter
  - `t` — run the unit tests
- Before committing: run the pretty printer, then the linter, then the unit tests, in that order.
  - Scope the test run to relevant tests when possible. If running the full suite takes ~30 seconds or less, run it all.
  - The Makefile aliases can be used, but it's fine to invoke tools directly (e.g., to pass flags that restrict the test scope).

# Language-Specific Notes

## Rust

- Use `rustfmt` for formatting and `clippy` for linting.
- Name the core crate `domain` (not `core` — conflicts with Rust's standard library crate).
- `lib.rs` contains only module declarations (`pub mod foo;`). Actual code lives in dedicated module files.
- Makefile should include these additional aliases beyond the standard `p`/`l`/`t`:
  - `c check` — `cargo check --all`
  - `b build` — `cargo build --all`
  - `r run` — `cargo run`
  - `br build-release` — `cargo build --release --all`
- Pre-commit hook runs in this order: `cargo check` → `cargo fmt --check` → `cargo clippy`. Do **not** run tests in the pre-commit hook.

# Git Workflow

- Only create commits when explicitly asked. Do not commit proactively after completing a task.
- When initializing a new repo, make a skeleton initial commit with this exact message: `🌚 Creatio ex nihilo`

# Git Commit Style

Commit messages follow the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention.

**Format:**
- Title: `<gitmoji> <subject>` — max 72 characters total, including the emoji and trailing space
- Body: additional context as needed
- Footer: co-author line

**Co-author footer:**
```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
